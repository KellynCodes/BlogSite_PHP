 # KellynCodes
 
This project is for lesson and practicie based.
Although the project is awesome but it doesn't have much styling.
HOW THE PROJECT WORKS: Just like the name implies it is a blog website that works this way...:
1. It collects the data that is inserted in the forms at admin/index.php file.
2. Sends the datas to the database and...
3. Also insert the image the user inserted in the form at admin/index.php to the image folder "uploads". 
4. It also have the admin side where the admin can view lists of blogs and can delete and manage which news is to be retained in the user sides.
NOTE: the projects is still in process. I will like to add some orther featutures like the login side where only 
registered user can have access to full blog page.
